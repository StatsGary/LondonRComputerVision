The computer vision code is hosted on my cloud account. Click the <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq5aEUcRx5IqgoASR6poEt9lj5EsrA?e=woq0g5">link</a> to access.

The presentation from the session will be available from the NHS-R Community Conference webpage. The link for this will be shared in due course.

If you have any questions - please contact me via my website <a href="https://hutsons-hacks.info/">Hutson's Hacks</a>. Alternatively, you can contact me on my Twitter and Linkedin accounts. Details for these are also found on my website.

I hope you found this session informative, and for those Deep Learners out there, I would love to see if you can get better than 72% accuracy on the models. Please drop me a line and we can discuss how you did this. 

Thanks all the followers and please watch my repos for more cool stuff.
